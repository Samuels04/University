## Introduction

This is a github repository for me to upload all the code that I will be creating throughout my degree. I'm 
Samuel Sanchez and I study at University of Oviedo.

## First year

On the first semester of the year this repository did not exist, so there isn't much from that time.

### 2nd Semester

All files will be kept in the folder **1st Year**, divided into the subfolders correspondant to the subjects (**Computer Science Fundamentals**,**Programming Methodology**)

## Second Year

---To be completed when year begins---
